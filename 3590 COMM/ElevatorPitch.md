Hello, my name is Wendell, and I am excited about the new position with your company. I noticed that you are looking for a candidate with mobile development experience, but let me tell you how my experience has gone above and beyond. In my last internship, I independently developed and maintained the WeChat mini-application client and iOS client for the company. And I migrated the company official website from Django to Vue.js and rewrote the backend system with SpringBoot so that it can still run under twice the load compared to the previous one. So I can fit the job very well. Here is my resume. Would you be willing to meet with me next week for an official interview?
