Next, answer these short essay questions (add more space as you need it):

1. List the five high-rated items you feel best describe you.
2. Describe five examples of how you have used or demonstrated these traits in the past.
3. For each of your top five rated items, explain why an employer might want to hire a person with this quality or trait.

I think the five high-rated items best descirbe me from the list is attention to detail, plans-organizes-prioritizes work‚Äù, intelligent, flexible, and optimistic.

One example of attention to detail is that when I write code, I will give variables and functions proper names and documentation to help understand the code, and for those blocks of code that are difficult to understand, I modularize them and give them detailed comments. Because of this trait, I don't get bugs in my code very often, and I can locate them quickly when they do occur. For the employer, the fewer bugs in the programmer's code, the more desirable the programmer is, and attention to detail can reduce the bug rate, so the employer might be more willing to hire the person.

For the trait plans-organizes-prioritizes work, I think a tool app I'm working on might be a good example. When I intended to write the app, I firstly planned out the basic framework and functional modules of the app, then I built an automated test environment to verify my idea and debug it, next, I wrote a command line version of the app to make sure the core of the app works properly, and only after the above things were done, I was able to officially start writing the app. My approach greatly reduces the code management load on my brain, because the amount of code for an app is usually more than 50,000, and the amount of files for the whole project is at least several dozen, so if I don't plan well, it's hard for me to effectively manage the development of this app by myself. For employers,  full stack programmer or an app programmer who can do it independently is very popular because it means that this programmer can be well qualified for various development positions like front-end and back-end.

For the trait intelligent, I would like to give some examples of my achievements. For example, I won the third prize in a provincial science competition in middle school, and I won the second prize in a national physics competition in high school. In college, although I chose math as my major, which I was not good at, my GPA still ranked at the top of my major, and I learned to write apps independently by self-learning in the computer science filed. For employers, I think intelligent people should be more popular because they will have better problem solving skills.

An example of flexibility might be reflected in the way I play the game. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is an open-world RPG with a lot of puzzles for players to solve. When I was working on these puzzles, I was often able to use multiple solutions to solve them instead of sticking to one solution. Although this may be related to the open design of the game, I think my flexibility also helped a lot. For employer, flexibility somehow means better problem solving ability, employers should also like people who have better problem solving abilities.

I am an optimistic person and I tend to prioritize the good side of things. Last night, my roommate told me that he was disliked in the study room, and the girl who was sitting next to him suddenly changed her seat. He felt very sad, but when I found out about it, I didn't think the girl dislikes him, and the change of position might be because the seat was cold, or there was her best friend next to the other seat. At the same time, I find that optimism brings more positive emotions, which keeps me in a happy mood. I don't know how the trait of optimism helps employers, maybe it means I have better stress resistance to deal with major incidents.
