1. To be a good software development engineer, you need to have a sense of innovation and the ability to plan for the future. Could you share your career plan for the next five years?

2. 1. Software engineer -> Full-stack developer -> Independent developer

3. In your resume, you mentioned your internship experience in the technology department of WoKu Company. Can you tell how your previous work experience could impact you in this position?

4. 1. Group work: git
   2. Complete application including dataset, UI, server client

5. At present, software development engineers are in hot demand in major technology enterprises in China. Please tell me why you choose this type of position, and why our company.

6. 1. I like programming, it feel great to implement and create things with code
   2. No 996, I could seek for work-life balance

7. China's 5G industry is gradually maturing. Tell us how software development can be used to solve the problems that may arise in the 5G era, and give some examples.

8. 1. 5G is more like a foundation and the driver of the next evaluation like AR, VR, and even MR possibly. And the biggest problem of 5G is the thermal, on mobile device, there is no smart phone could run 5G with a high demand of CPU or GPU, which prevents the spread of 5G to smaller devices.
   2. As software engineer, we could use some technique called smart 5G, which swap 5G if needed like in some situation that needs wide bandwidth and low latency of 5G, which could generally solve the thermal problem of 5G, however, the biggest challenge is still for the hardware development, this software improvement is just a temporary solution.

9. In an era of information explosion, global software development is becoming more and more complex, which requires software engineers to carry out high-intensity work to adapt to the trend of software development globalization. Do you thrive under such extreme pressure?

10. 1. I don’t think the more and more complex software development would really carry out high-intensity work, because the tools that engineers used are also developed quicker and quicker, and more and more Intelligent. 
    2. And for software development, the core is not how many framework or language you’ve learned, it’s about how you have understand the computer and system. When you really get into one framework, the others would also be much simpler. For instance, I have learned the Swift programming language before Java, so I would easily know learn and understand the similar concept inside Java, after learning the syntax of Java, I found that I already know a lot about Java.
