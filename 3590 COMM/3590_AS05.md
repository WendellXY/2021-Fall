## Main

### Why are you interested in joining this company

I have been using this company's products for a long time, I think their products are really good. This company supports remote work, which gives me more freedom to live, in other words, I can choose to travel and work at the same time, or work from home instead of rushing to company every weekday. Besides, this company is "965", or working from 9 AM to 6 PM, 5 days a week; with most Chinese IT companies being "996" or even "1007", 965 is a really good option.

### Requirement & Your strength

Requirement 1: master Swift and JavaScript language. 

I have learned the Swift programming language for almost 4 years, and I have develop several iOS app for myself independently ; I also had built my personal website by HTML/CSS/JavaScript and had distributed on my personal server by myself.

Requirement 2: have a good level of English, or at least be able to read and write.

I learned at Wenzhou-Kean University and started learning computer knowledge in pure English. So there is no doubt about my English skills.

### Requirement & Your shortcoming

Knowledge of desktop/mobile software interaction principles and design specifications.

Although I have developed some apps by myself independently, I did not go directly into the interaction principles and design specifications of software development; sometimes I was even troubled by them when developing apps.

### Based on your answers above, will you still apply for this job? Why?

Yes, I will still try to apply for this job. Because the pay and environment  of this company is very good for me, and I have met the requirements of the most critical one – code ability – the other is not a big problem for me. And I still have enough time to imporve my weakness, for instance, I could start imporving my personal application based on the iOS/macOS application design principle to learn the interaction principles and design specifications.
