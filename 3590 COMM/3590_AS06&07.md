**Email Subject**: Xinyu Wang for iOS Software Development Engineer

### Main

Dear Fang,

I would like to express my interest in applying for the position of iOS Software Development Engineer that was recently made available in your company.

I believe that my degree in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Wenzhou-Kean University has prepared me for this position. As a student, I was equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to develop iOS software independently.

During my five months internship at WoKu Companyâ€™s Technology Department, I independently developed the iOS version and the WeChat Mini-Program version of the second-hand trading platform based on latest SwiftUI and Alamofire framework as the frontend part of the whole second-hand trading system. For the backend, I updated the backend trading system with SpringBoot and deployed it on the Linux server by Ngnix and Radius.

With this application letter, I attach herewith my resume for your full consideration. Thanks for taking your time to review my application, looking forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Xinyu Wang
